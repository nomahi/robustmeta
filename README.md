## Robust Inference for Meta-Analysis with Influential Outlying Studies

An R package for implementing the robust inference methods for meta-analysis involving influential outlying studies. Robust inferences for fixed-effect and random-effects models based on density power divergence are implementable, which is a robust criterion developed in machine learning theory.
